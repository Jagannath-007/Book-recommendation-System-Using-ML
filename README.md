# 📚 Book Recommender System Using Machine Learning | Collaborative Filtering Based

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly vital in today’s fast-paced world. With limited time and countless options, people rely on intelligent systems to make quicker and better decisions. This project focuses on building a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering to suggest books based on user interests.

## 💡 About the Project

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that recommends books similar to the ones a user likes. The core model is built using **Collaborative Filtering** with the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to identify similar user preferences.

### 🎯 Objective

To recommend personalized book suggestions using a user-item interaction matrix, helping users discover books they’re likely to enjoy based on the preferences of similar users.

## 🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems

### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Uses item features and user preferences.
- Examples: YouTube, Twitter.
- Embeddings are created based on features like author, genre, etc.

### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering (Used in this project)
- Based on user-user or item-item similarity.
- Assumes if User A and User B like the same book, they might like each other's favorites too.
- Limitation: Cold start problem for new users/items.

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Recommendation
- Combines content-based and collaborative approaches.
- More accurate and used in modern systems.

## 🧠 Model Workflow (KNN Based)

1. Load the dataset
2. Initialize the value of `k` (number of neighbors)
3. Calculate distances between books using Euclidean Distance
4. Sort and select top `k` nearest neighbors
5. Recommend similar books based on those neighbors

## 📁 Dataset Used

- [GoodBooks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset)
- Includes book titles, authors, ratings, and user data
